ZENDONE
=======

Zendone is a clone of the Zendo[1], which is an universal game in which the
goal is to discover a rule (ie, "reach enlightment"). A configuration of
atoms ("koan") can either match the unknown rule or not. The players can test
their hypothesis of what the rule might look like by evaluating arbitary
koans.

The following game types are currently implemented in Zendone:

  * regex: The koans are 3-letter strings that match [abc]{3} and rules are
           regular expressions.


BASIC CONCEPT
=============

At the beginning of each game, you will be given two koans. One will match
the rule that you are about to discover, the other will not. Now you can
either create variations of these koans or think of completely different 
ones. The system will tell you for each koan wether it is true or false.

For example, the beginning of a session can look like this:

  True koan:     abd
  False koan:    bda
  >>> abc
  True
  >>> bbc
  False

You can query the system to evaluate a koan for an unlimited number of times.
Once you have an idea of how the rule might look like, you can simply enter
a regular expression:

  >>> /a/
  Nah, /a/ can not be the solution, because
    * it does match false koan 'bda'

The game ends when you reached enlightenment (i.e., you found the rule).
