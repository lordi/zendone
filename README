ZENREGEX
========

Zenregex is a clone of the Zendo game[1] with strings as koans and regular
expressions as rules.


BASIC CONCEPT
=============

At the beginning of each game, you will be given two koans. One will match the
rule that you are about to discover, the other will not. Now you can either 
create variations of these koans or think of completely different ones. The
system will tell you for each koan wether it is true or false.

For example, the beginning of a session can look like this:

  True koan:     abd
  False koan:    bda
  >>> abc
  True
  >>> bbc
  False

You can query the system to evaluate a koan for an unlimited number of times.
Once you have an idea of how the rule might look like, you can simply enter
a regular expression:

  >>> /a/
  Nah, /a/ can not be the solution, because
    * it does match false koan 'bda'

The game ends when you reached enlightenment (i.e., you found the rule).
