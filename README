ZENDONE
=======

Zendone is a clone of the Zendo game[1]. Zendo is a universal game where the
goal is to guess a rule. The players can test their hypothesis of what the
rule looks like by asking the game master to evalute arbitary koans. The game
master states wether the given koan matches the rule or not.

The following game types are currently implemented in Zendone:

  * regex: The koans are strings that match [abc]{3} and rules are
           regular expressions.


BASIC CONCEPT
=============

At the beginning of each game, you will be given two koans. One will match
the rule that you are about to discover, the other will not. Now you can
either create variations of these koans or think of completely different 
ones. The system will tell you for each koan wether it is true or false.

For example, the beginning of a session can look like this:

  True koan:     abd
  False koan:    bda
  >>> abc
  True
  >>> bbc
  False

You can query the system to evaluate a koan for an unlimited number of times.
Once you have an idea of how the rule might look like, you can simply enter
a regular expression:

  >>> /a/
  Nah, /a/ can not be the solution, because
    * it does match false koan 'bda'

The game ends when you reached enlightenment (i.e., you found the rule).
